It's my journey on my everyday walking habit

## Methodology
Simple habitual changes that got me into regular walking habit

**important**
To understand your own interests

*note* I am keeping this simple

You can use the `len()` function to get the length of any dict type of variable in python

```python
# This is Python code
def not_hello_world():
    print(""Time to read a new book!"")
```
### I do not miss to carry a

#### How I created this habit to go on a walk everyday morning without a miss?
1. Coffee
2. Book to read at least 2 pages per day
3. A small talk with my Cafe staffs
